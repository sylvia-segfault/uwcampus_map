# Create an empty graph
created graph graph3

# Add 3 nodes to graph3
added node node1 to graph3
added node node2 to graph3
added node node3 to graph3

# Add 2 edges to graph3
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph3
added edge edge2 from node1 to node3 in graph3

# Returns a list of children of the given vertex
# in graph3
the children of node1 in graph3 are: node2(edge1) node3(edge2)
