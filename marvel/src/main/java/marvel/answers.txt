Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from previous assignments,
and why those changes were made below. If you made no changes, state that
explicitly. (See the marvel assignment spec for details.)

1.
I changed the Edge class inside the graph from private to public, and added
getter methods for its private fields because it is helpful for BFS
algorithm to get the information about the given edge and is helpful
for writing the test driver.

2.
For my representation of graph, I changed my graph from Map<String, Set<Edge>>
to Map<String, List<Edge>> because it is more convenient when we want to
use a comparator to sort the edges in both BFS algorithm and the test driver.

3.
I removed hashCode and equals methods in the Edge class because they were
not necessary and would not be used.

4.
For both addVertex and addEdge class, I removed the exception handler. Instead,
I chose to return true if the operation is done successfully, otherwise return
false. It is helpful for building the graph with the given input file because
it signifies whether there is a duplicated vertex or a duplicated edge.
