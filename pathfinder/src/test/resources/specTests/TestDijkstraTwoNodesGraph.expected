# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm on
# a graph that contains two nodes which are
# connected by two different edge labels

created graph graph
added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added edge 10.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 5.000 from A to B in graph
path from A to B:
A to B with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000
