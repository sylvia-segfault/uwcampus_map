# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm on
# a graph that contains three nodes

created graph graph
added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph
added edge 6.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 5.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 2.000 from A to C in graph
added edge 3.000 from A to C in graph
path from A to B:
A to B with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000
path from A to C:
A to C with weight 2.000
total cost: 2.000
